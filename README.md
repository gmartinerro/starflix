The **starflix project** shows a small SPA to search the sapi.co database for movies and show all the characters appearing in the star wars saga.


The idea is simulate a NETFLIX-like style interface where the user can find:

* A search bar to search a movie by title (using the search endpoint of swapi.)
* A summary of the currently selected/found movie.
* A list of alredy seen movies in a netflix-style strip
* A automatic slider with the set of characters found in swapi.co.
